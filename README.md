# Orthite

Orthite is PHP framework currently in development. I am doing this for self education purpose, not that I am going to make a new Laravel or Symfony, this will be much simpler than those giants with a large comunity. It is just to test my capabilities as a junior developer and to produce an example project for my portfolio.

The core project does not have any source code yet. It will be constructed of several other packages later. To see a progress you can check:

* [orthite-db](https://github.com/bogdanpet/orthite-db)
* [orthite-di](https://github.com/bogdanpet/orthite-di)
* [orthite-router](https://github.com/bogdanpet/orthite-router)
